# Project V : Recognition using Deep Networks

## Created by Ronak Bhanushali and Rucha Pendharkar on 4/1/24

The goal of this project is to build and train a deep network capable of completing a recognition task. These recognition tasks were mainly implemented using the MNIST Digit and MNIST Fashion Datasets.

Folder descriptions
greek_test - handwritten alpha, beta, gamma
greek_train_custom - handwritten lambda,psi,pi,omega,theta and tau for training
greek_test_custom - handwritten lambda,psi,pi,omega,theta and tau for testing


## Features
- **custom_convolution.py** : Contains model definitions for tasks 1 to 4 and extension 3
- **analyze.py** : For task 2
- **inference.py**: For task 1
- **preprocess.py**: For preprocessing images for tasks containing custom datasets
- **task4.py** : For task 4 and extension 2
- **train.py** : For training the network for task 1
- **transfer_learning.py** : For task 3 and extension 1
- **plot.py** : For plotting results for task 4 and extension 2

## Checkpoints

## Environment 
The scripts were authored using VS Code, and code compilation took place in the Ubuntu 20.04.06 LTS environment, utilizing CMake through the terminal.


## NOTE
Please note that the submission contains two proposals as both team mates are working on different final projects.
